# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to acquire more information about temperature trends in Hawaii before a new surf shop is opened there. This project gathers the temperature data of Oahu for the months of June and December. This information will help determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The weather data for this project was stored in a SQLite database. The analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook. 


### Resources
Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
Software: SQLite 3.38.2, SQLAlchemy, Python 3.9.12, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8, Pandas 1.4.2
